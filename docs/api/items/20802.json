We the children of the land who find rest under the folds, we pledge our lives, our hearts and our sacred honor to protect thee, our country, and the liberty of the American people, forever!Isabel A. EnnisUnder the Red, White and BlueFights Our Army, for Me and for You.This is the golden age - the age of opportunity to do for mankind. Ours is the rare privilege to aid in the reincarnation of the national soul and the advancement of civilization, and in this you, yes each and every one of you, have a part. Let not opportunity call in vain nor any of us fail of place upon the roll of honor. - S. S. Menken, Pres. Nat’l Sec. League.“We join ourselves to not party that does not carry the flag and keep step to the music of the Union.” - Rufus Choate.Americanism is a question of spirit, conviction and purpose, not of creed or birthplace. - Theodore Roosevelt.Our soldiers are fighting to save us. Little children in France and Belgium had their homes burned down. The fathers and mothers of many of them were killed. They were driven out of their own country. They are cold and hungry and ragged and unhappy. Some of them go to school in cold cellars. They are always in danger of being killed. Our soldiers fight to keep us safe. They don’t want us to be burned out of house and home. Little children can’t fight. But they can be good soldiers in some ways. Soldiers stand straight and sit straight. They hold their heads up and look honestly at everyone. Little children can do so, too. Soldiers get strong by working hard in the open air. Children can work in gardens; they can sell W.S.S. and run errands and get strong by this work in the open air. Soldiers are respectful and obedient. They do at once what they are told to do. Children can obey their captain, the teacher and their colonel and lieutenant-colonel, father and mother. If the teacher had monitors, the children can think of them as corporals. Soldiers eat plain food and do not complain. Children can do the same and save food for the soldiers. Every child is a little soldier of Uncle Sam.The People of the United StatesA.

Over half of the people, including the children and the vast proportion of the women, are unregistered by occupation.Prof. A. B. Hart, Harvard UniversityThe Spirit of Paul RevereDon’t hear him when the night Drops its curtain dark and still, Hoof-beats sounding on the hill, Clattering through the village street, Drumming by the lonely farms, Calling loudly as he goes - “Wake! to arms.”Can’t you see him as he rides Like a shadow in the night, Streaming cloak, peruke untied, With the moon to mark his flight, Rousing every sleeping house To the thrill of war’s alarms, Knocking at the bolted doors- “Wake! to arms.”‘Tis the soul of Paul Revere speeding on from coast to coast, With the message that of yore Summoned forth a patriot host- lest the foe be at your gates Leave your factories and farms, On to France and victory! “Wake! to arms.”-Minna IrvingBy Courtesy of Leslie’s Weekly. (Copyrighted.)Love of CountryThe good citizen supports his country against any foreign country. Naturalized citizens are on the same footing as native born, and should always be so treated. Non-naturalized aliens are here by courtesy and bound to act accordingly. National unity is essential in order that the United States may be enabled to uphold justice, public order, and international right among the nations of the world.Patriotism is shown byPaying war taxes. Subscription to Liberty Loans. Electing and holding in office men who intelligently serve America first and at all times. Interest in and aid to soldiers’families.Patriotic talk to neighbors and friends. Civilian service for the Government, wherever possible. Membership in and participation in patriotic organizations. Subscriptions to national war organizations. Respect for and aid to individual soldiers and sailors. Military service, from those of suitable age. Conservation of food and the curtailment of luxuries.Prof. A. B. Hart, Harvard UniversityThe National Security League, Etta V.
