This Aggregation should be considered an expression within the ORE context of the object of the relationship, as it is broadly equivalent to the resource. For example, the Aggregation may consist of the resources which, together, make up a journal article which has a DOI assigned to it. The Aggregation is not the article to which the DOI was assigned, but is a representation of it in some manner.",
